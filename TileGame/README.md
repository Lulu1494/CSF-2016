Tiles can be drawn using images or just as a solid color rectangle. 

Only tiles that are within the camera bounds are drawn. Efficient! 

The current demo features 3 map layouts and 9 regions from Casual Quest. 
You can press R to randomize the map at any point. 
You can press the Arrow keys to move the camera.
